How can they allow restaurants to just send whatever they feel like instead of refunding or contacting the customer. Just eat in an email claims to have tried to contact me but that's a lie. Then they had the nerve to ask me to review their help service even though they didn't reach out to help.

Just Eat,1,Just Eat - Terrible Experience Again,"Today 3/5/2025 This is to inform everyone that I got my refund back, of ‚Ç¨25 after my last review, however I will still advice be careful ordering around the IFSC area of DublinI had my second worst experience with Just Eat again. My food was not delivered, yet the delivery person claimed it was. Who gave him the delivery code? This is my second experience like this. It feels like this guy is stealing food and falsely claiming it was delivered. I called customer service, and the representative was empathetic, promising a refund within 10 days. I've lost ‚Ç¨50 to this company twice. Many say they are good, but it seems I'm unlucky for the second time. It's unfair; you work so hard, and then someone messes with your food...if I get my money back, I will delete the app from my phone and never use again and warn people in my office at the IFSC to stay clear of this folks, they dont get it right...lucky are those that have good to say, stuck eating digestive biscuits with a cup of coffee after losing ‚Ç¨25",2025-05-03,Olumuyiwa,N/A

I was not contacted by the driver and the doorbell never rang.When I contacted customer service (their is no number to call, just message), I asked them to deliver it again, but they told me they couldn't because it was marked 'delivered', total nonsense. My food didn't arrive, contact another of your drivers to get it done, straightforward as that! A refund was issued supposedly (though was told it would take 5 - 7 days to get it, so I still need to check), but it's absurd that such a straightforward job could not be done, while I'm waiting, absolutely hunger!!I was offered a ‚Ç¨15 voucher as a, so called, apology, however I said if they were really sorry they'd send the ‚Ç¨15 to my bank account, of course they wouldn't.
