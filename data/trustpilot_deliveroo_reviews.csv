Deliveroo,1,Absolute Disaster-Read Review if you need a laugh,"Today I ordered a delivery from M&S and it was not an experience I ever want to repeat. Firstly it took 2 hours to get from a store that is a 10 Minute drive away from my workplace. 2 Hours later I received an email from Deliveroo saying that their was an issue with my order so the Delivery driver had to go back to the store to get a new one. Still not sign of it until I got an email showing me a picture of where they had left my M&S food order because I wasnt answering the Door or my Calls (Totally untrue) . They delivered my Food Shopping to a ditch on the side of the road !!!! I Kid you not and what I am trying to get past is how the Delivery driver decided this was a real address. I have been burnt twice now by deliveroo, I wont be burnt a 3rd time. Disaster",2025-10-16,Suzanne,N/A

Deliveroo,1,The worst customer support,"An order was advertised as 20-30 mins delivery, arrives an hour and ten minutes later. Customer Support advised he would grant me credit, but the only credit I received was from the standard deliveroo plus ""on time"" guarantee. A ""Senior Agent"" was barely more helpful, just constant canned ""I'm sorry, your feedback will be taken on board"" and another small amount of credit. No explanations on the late order, no explanation on being mislead in the credit, I asked the SA to stop apologising and get me answers or a solution, so she kept apologising and telling me my feedback was important before deciding we were going in circles and ending the chat.",2025-10-06,Trevor,N/A
Deliveroo,1,No help! Very disappointing customer service! No point in website 😕,"I ordered of deliveroo and I just got false advertising off the menu on deliveroo, and I wouldn't have ordered it if the description didn't say it was a certain Item but it turned out to be a completely different item,  deliveroo wouldn't help me and there's no way to contact the restaurant so I've lost out and it's very disappointing! Like the whole point of this website is to deal with restaurants for you but instead I just got told to do it myself and I have no idea how to do that! I don't understand the point of this website when customer service doesn't even help at all! I should have got a refund straight away but instead I got them telling me to do it myself! Dissatisfied is an understatement! 🙄😒",2025-09-24,Amy,N/A

I said, ""Well, now you should tell Deliveroo that you did not finalize the delivery."" However, he put the code in and finalized it anyway. When I asked for a refund, they tried to contact him, and he refused to answer, so I got no refund and no food. They just don't care about real customers and let us get scammed by drivers. Totally unreliable company with ridiculous customer service and customer retention system.No explanation, no help, just automated replies and complete silence from customer service.

We treated them to a takeaway at their favourite chippy. After unpacking the food we noticed that one bag of chips was half empty and was 'closed' differently to the other 3. Very suspicious as our friends told us they always order there. Maybe that's why the delivery guy, clearly a migrant from the IPAS up the road, went off in a hurry.

All was good until I received my order as we sat down to enjoy our meal opened it and found out it was beef instead of chicken.rang zaytoon lady on the phone said she’ll send another order out. After 50 minutes called them again lady said she can’t send the order as delivroo refunded my account. Contacted delivroo online mentioned what’s wrong. After few minutes received a email saying they have refunded €22.40 out of €41.08. That’s when I decided to call them and ask what the story is . Man over the phone said you will only get 22.40 back as rest of your order was on discount. I told him I didn’t ask for discount when I was ordering . It’s simple as  I spent €41.08 on delivery I want all my money back. I asked him to put his supervisor on and told the supervisor if you don’t refund my money I’ll take you to court . It’s only then they refunded my money. Painful experience. Spoiled our evening. Spent 2 hours dealing with these incompetent people . I’ll never use them again.

The Rider left the dirty packet in front of the apartment and the food packets at the side of the apartment. The Rider had no civic sense, and presumably not aware that trash has to be disposed off at bin. Deliveroo has no control over these riders, in fact most of the riders name on system vs actual rider who is delivering doesn't match. This is in fact serious as Deliveroo will have no trail if something serious happens. A so called customer service manager by the name Carl couldn't not resolve the issue and said he is person with in charge and doesn't have anyone to escalate.

Deliveroo,1,Refused refund after not receiving my order!,"I wish I could give zero stars. I ordered food through Deliveroo on the weekend worth close to 50 euro. About an hour after the order was confirmed, about 9:40 PM, my food still didn't arrive, so I checked the website again for an update, I saw that my food, apparently, was delivered at 9:24 PM. I contacted support wondering what happened, and demanded a refund/credit (as the restaurant I ordered from had since closed). I was told the rider tried ringing me, couldn't get in contact so he left it on my doorstep. He did no such thing. I didn't receive any phone calls, and nothing was left on my door. I told them this, and I was told that because I wasn't available to take the calls, I was responsible for the cost. The rider never knocked on my door! He never even entered my property! I told them this, and when I was asked to confirm my address, I did, and I was told that the address I provided did not match the address the had on record (before I contacted support I had to confirm details the had for me during the 'review my case' part. One of the details was my address, and it was exactly my address!). I sent the manager (I spoke to three managers that night for close to 3 hours) a screenshot from my laptop of the section where they asked to confirm my address. I told him they did have the correct address, the same address I had just confirmed, and he again said it didn't match what they had on record and ended the chat. The insisted that the driver came to my address, didn't get an answer from the phone, left my order on the doorstep and left, and it was my responsibility and there would be no refund or credit. We have a Ring doorbell which detects motion and begins recording. No delivery rider came to my house. We also have CCTV, and when I checked that later, I saw a rider pulled up on the road outside a neighbours house, sat there for a few minutes and left with my food. He never once got off the bike. Apparently he tried to ring me, and because I didn't get his call I was responsible for the cost and no refund could be issued! The DELIVERY rider never came to my front door and knocked! Apparently, for what ever reason, if you don't answer/get their calls, they can just leave with your order, and it's your fault and you pay the cost. Apparently delivery rider/drivers don't have to knock on your door with your order. They gave me some nonsense about the riders being afraid to knock on doors because of babies or old people! I had a similar incident a week or two before where I was waiting on food, this time I checked the order sooner and saw someone was trying to ring me. I went to the door and saw the rider sitting there on his bike. Never thought to get off and knock (this was mid afternoon, too. So that nonsense about them being afraid to knock because of disturbing someone was pure bollox!). It could have been the same rider. I have never had this experience before where a DELIVERY driver/rider wouldn't knock on the door and then just left with my food! And then to be told it was my fault, and be refused a refund/credit was disgraceful! I'm taking this to their head office! Never use Deliveroo again! Use JustEat!",2025-01-07,Neil,N/A

Deliveroo,1,Ban Masked Deliveroo Riders/Abusive Intimidating Riders,"I am writing to raise a serious concern regarding the behavior of delivery drivers, which reflects a growing number of similar complaints found online. Earlier today, I was verbally abused, intimidated, and menaced by one of your e-scooter drivers as I was on my way home. Despite being in the privacy of my own vehicle, I was subjected to verbal assault. Naturally, I retaliated, as I will not tolerate being abused or verbally attacked by anyone while in my own car.This incident reflects a larger issue with delivery drivers acting irresponsibly on the road, creating unsafe and intimidating situations for other road users. The fact that many drivers are allowed to wear balaclavas or fully cover their faces while driving only heightens public discomfort and complicates accountability.For the safety of your drivers and the general public, I strongly urge your company to ban the use of balaclavas or face coverings by drivers while operating e-scooters, electric bikes, or any other vehicles. Drivers should also be held accountable for their conduct to ensure they follow legal and respectful behavior on the road.Addressing this ongoing issue and improving the conduct of your drivers is essential for the safety of road users and to uphold the reputation of your company. I expect a prompt response and immediate action to investigate this incident and prevent future occurrences.I have written a formal complaint also in anticipate Deliveroo's reply including an investigation. The abusive male driver who verbally attacked me, a petite woman in my own private vehicle whilst minding my own business is a danger and should be held accountable.",2024-09-18,Elanka Adamczyk,N/A

I definitely wouldn't have chosen a cyclist if I had an option. When he arrived, he was so angry about the distance between the restaurant and my home. He demanded money like a burglar covering his face with a black mask very aggressively. Ireland doesn't have a tipping culture like the US and why would anyone want to tip this person after being threatened by. I couldn't believe I had to experience this and their customer service just gave me genetic copy and paste messages, just couldn't care less.

I also think the company policy encourages them to do so.Any other reputable company like Ubereats has a solid message to the driver. If the guest does not receive and give you the security number in his application, it means your food has not been delivered.

Deliveroo,1,DO USE DELIVEROO,"DO NOT USE DELIVEROO, I ordered from mc Donald’s in lucan, the delivery driver too 1.5 hours delivering. He stood outside for 20 minutes and I got a call from DELIVEROO English number saying he was outside. I went out to get my food , his face was fully covered in a black mask. He shouted “ I need number before I give u food, being my 2nd time usin DELIVEROO I gave number because he wouldn’t give me food until I gave it to him. He was on his fone entering the number, I said where’s my food to be told it was delivered 30 minutes ago, I asked him y is he here if he has no food, and he acted like he couldn’t understand me, then he shouted u got food 30 minutes ago, you hv problem you ring McDonald s. I couldn’t understand why he was here if he had no food, so rang customer services and went through everything. I’m a single mother, and today is a treat day for my daughter, I don’t hv 25 euro to just waste, they were acting very understanding but insisted because I gave the delivery number , there’s no way I can get a refund. And explained in future do not give the number till u hv food in your hand. I went mad, it made no sense, because the guy refused to give me my food until I gave number, being new to the app I assumed that I’d naturally get my food. I used to use just eat but decided to use DELIVEROO to try them out with coupon codes( which by the way DONT WORK) so the girl put me through to complaint s. Another 40 minutes of I understand your upset and we don’t want you having this experience but because you gave the number we can’t refund u because it says u got your food. This guy was very sly, he acted like he couldn’t understand me to get onto DELIVEROO and speak perfect English. I was so upset because I genuinely Dnt hv that money to just waste so I drove up to the mc Donald’s who I got the food from. Ask for a manager and explained what happened, she was amazing and remembered the guy coming in for the order, she only remembered him because he had a full face head mask and he just stood out. They have nothing to do with DELIVEROO just put the orders through.!I was so mad I just wanted to let them know , to take note and that’s all, I wasn’t expecting food or money, she said look I’m so mad for you and I’m so sorry that happened, do you want some food, I said oh no I’m not here for that it’s just principle, she said she completely understood and has experienced bad delivery with DELIVEROO, I lost my appetite by this point but I ordered a cheese burger and chips nd drink for my daughter. She said do u want anything else because it was 25 euro, she was so kind and understanding. I was so impressed, they could hv just taken note but she knew the feeling of loosing money nd no food for DELIVEROO. I hv to say the way the driver acted nd the response from DELIVEROO it’s just a horrible service, no other place used numbers to give to delivery driver so they obviously have had a problem with ppl not delivering food and just saying it, he obviously took my food and gave it away and seen I was only new so he put on the act to get the number. I should hv taken a video of him saying that my food was delivered by someone else but he needed the number of me regardless.

They refunded me less than it would now cost me to get that second drink on the deliveroo app on KFC (where order was placed). When I contacted the customer service and asked them to make it right they said there's nothing they can do as refund was system generated. So instead of just crediting me the difference or getting the driver to bring a second drink they just said sorry they will take my feedback for the future. I told the customer service agent they didn't help resolve and that I won't be using deliveroo again, all agent said was sorry to hear. Ever wonder how to lose business....this right here is it, very much a ""don't care attitude"", they would rather not make it right, when Deliveroos revenue is down and they wonder why ,it's because of things like this, it's the principal of doing right by those that you need to operate your business( DELIVEROO NEEDS TO REALISE THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY DELIVERY SERVICE OUT THERE). I refuse to use deliveroo again.",2023-10-14,Pharen Pillai,N/A

Deliveroo,1,where’s my food gone 🤔,Me and my massive family with babies and my wife ordered some food for our dinner and when the ‘food’ arrived there was none! It only came with 2 drinks and ice creams by this i am really appalled on this vile behaviour my children are crying thinking they won’t be able to eat and was looking forward to this exciting treat as we rarely order. I seriously think this needs sorting out as money has been wasted and time. Even more so this isn’t the first time this has happened it isn’t ok 👎 i do not recommend deliveroo at all as i’m sick to my stomach with stress from how poor the customer service is not even being able to call them to ask for the food to get delivered or even a refund. Do better deliveroo i’m not impressed. 👿👿👿👿😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬👎👎👎,2023-09-14,lucia tompkinson,N/A
Deliveroo,1,Absolute rip off,Driver made no attempt to deliver. We were all home. Got a message to say food was left in the garden - it wasn’t. Contacted them and they said the driver would not return and I wasn’t eligible for a refund because they had attempted to deliver. Restaurant won’t engage as they are a third party supplier. So I literally just gave them money for nothing and they spoiled a family birthday dinner. Live chat support was incredibly unhelpful.,2023-09-13,Maria Mcnally,N/A

I asked for a refund but he didn't understand me so we spent 15 mins speaking into an app trying to translate back and forth to each other. He took a photo of the food he had dropped on the ground as evidence for Deliveroo that the order was not delivered. However, I never received a refund. I contacted deliveroo and waited ages for them to reply. They told me that I needed a photo of the food on the ground as proof. At this stage the food was already in the bin. I asked if they could contact the driver as he had a photo, but they said they had no way of knowing who delivered the food. I won't be using them again",2023-08-25,Lilly Shield,N/A

Deliveroo,1,Appalling customer service & scamming money from my debit card.,"I have never left a bad review in my life but just felt like people had to be warned with how appalling their customer service is. I have never had a worse experience. I have never had a deliveroo account and I haven't ordered from the site but it came to my attention that there was a charge for Deliveroo plus on my debit card. I thought this might be a mistake as a result of my amazon prime account which you can activate a free deliveroo plus membership with ( i never did ). I rang the customer service number where i was told they can see the transactions made on my card and that it is not coming from my deliveroo account, however they couldn't disclose the email address of the person making the transaction as the ""data isn't related to me personally."" Right. So they could see that the transactions were fraudulent and i was told , which i have in writing in an email, that there would be a temporary hold on my card while it was investigated further by their financial team. This was the 7th of july of this month and yet another deliveroo plus charge was placed on my card 31st of July. I rang the same support number again and was talking to the same woman as before but this time was told i have to email the support email address because it's out of her hands. So i emailed this email address and as someone else said in their review , i was met with generic / automatic responses and every single time i replied with details they asked for it was someone else replying. Over three days i had 7 if not more different people reply when i would reply to one of their emails and each time the person would be uneducated on the situation and ask for the same details again. When i first saw the transaction for deliveroo plus i was immediately going to cancel my card but seen as the only transactions on my card that were not my own was for deliveroo plus i didn't because as i said above i was told that any future payments for deliveroo with my card would be blocked as they know they are fraudulent and yet i was still charged a second time. I currently have my card frozen because i'm a 3rd level student and don't want any more money taken , they customer service team is an absolute joke , all i want is my refund for at least the second transaction if not both and then i will cancel my card because they won't refund it if my card is different . Everyone who is saying that they are a scam is 100%, they will do absolutely anything to avoid refunds and it seems deliberate that they reply with a new person every time. I will never ever use deliveroo.",2023-08-06,sarah _,N/A

I was so shocked at this that I told him he was a rude person, I went back to my house and he came back over and started kicking in my front door.

Deliveroo,1,Disgraceful Handling from their Support Team,Our cyclist was pulling into our estate so I decided to go down to meet him. When I got there he did not speak any English and gave our food away to another lady living in our apartment complex without asking for the code. The only way he could know if it was me was through the code because he could not understand simple English. So I provided him the code so he would know it was for me. He then proceeded to cycle away in a panic saying he does not speak english. I complained to the support department about the incident and they will not help because the code was given.

I complained as normal through the app and got a credit for the missing items but no formal apology. I then went on help again and asked for the tip I had provided to be taken back of the rider. Seemingly this is impossible. I got some nonsense that they would use to improve blah blah blah. What I fail to understand is why Deliveroo continue to have confidence in their management team in Ireland. They have obviously never heard of customer experience or would be reading these reviews and trying to rectify the issues they have. What makes it worse is that I actually hold shares in Deliveroo from when they launched on UK stock market. No wonder they don’t make money. Think the only sensible thing is to write to the outlets they deliver for and ask that they maybe sign with another delivery company.,2023-05-12,Rob Walsh,N/A

Contacted the support which you can't ring and sort straight away. It is just a chat function that will order an investigation for a refund that can take up to 48 hours. This does not help when you have waited an hour and half for food. Contact the resturant and they said are food was picked up by driver so either driver took are food or dropped it off somewhere else. No solution from there support would never use them again. Mistakes and delays can happen but there customer service is non existing. Just eat customer service is a lot better to deal with.,2023-03-17,Katie,N/A
Deliveroo,1,I wouldnt even give one star STAY AWAY,I wouldnt even give one star. Order never arrived. Customer service is a joke. Saying it takes 48hours to investigate. Not hard to ring your driver should take 2 minutes. I would stay well away from this company. Just eat will be getting my orders,2023-03-17,Dean  Lawlor,N/A
Deliveroo,1,No call. No Knock. €63 Takeaway and Wine stolen by Driver,"No call. No knock. Logged into my online account on my PC to find it was ""delivered' 15 mins ago. Restaurant referred me to Deliveroo support. Despite not having app, rider supposedly sent me loads of app notifications he was outside. I sent screenshots of both my phone notifications and emails from Deliveroo to show this to be false. The front door is 3m from the street, but no knock. No call. Support say no refund and no I can't have proof he was ever in the area. I know what happened. He saw the order contained a luxury €63 takeaway including a bottle of wine from a very nice Japanese restaurant called Osaka in Cork City Centre and said, 'Oh that's nice, I'll rob the customer and Deliveroo will cover my tracks for me'. Don't order from these thieves",2023-03-14,Laura H,N/A
Deliveroo,1,Simply a fraud,"Simple - nobody ever showed up to our door but the app marked our order as delivered.We immediately contacted the customer service who simply confirmed the system information: ""Order delivered"".We pointed out that we were at home, lights on and all, why would anybody deliver food on a driveway without even making a call, nevermind knocking at a very accessible door?Nothing, ""our system reports that the order has been delivered"".Not only a fraud of a rider (hope you enjoyed our dinner, bro), but a fraud of a company, totally incapable of guaranteeing a minimum of service (and frankly, of sense).Unless you are truly desperate, stay away from Deliveroo. Much safer options out there.",2023-03-14,Leo,N/A
Deliveroo,1,You almost have to admire how little they care about customer service,"The customer service is astonishing. The rider didnt show up with the delivery, he messaged me to say he was here which he wasnt. I re-confirmed the street and asked if he was on it (twice). He ignored that, complained about the rain and then presumably dumped the food somewhere. I went to the livechat app for a refund and they refused because the rider said he had delivered. End of story.Farcial.",2023-03-09,Barry,N/A
Deliveroo,1,"Long wait time, not enough drivers obv.","Placed my first and last order tonight. Ordered 1 hour plus ago. Just keep pushing out the expected delivery time, driver not assigned yet apparently. Have you got like 1 driver? After the hour ticked over, deliveroo did cancel the order for me and apply a €10 credit. The trouble is: Do they even have enough drivers that I can even reliably place an order to spend that credit?",2023-03-07,Robaird O Riain,N/A
Deliveroo,1,No refund on order not arriving,"On the 25th of February I ordered food from Deliveroo. I recently had an accident with my hand so am unable to cook or use my wheelchair the last two weeks, so besides my lovely mam cooking for me was relying on this takeaway that day. The order was also extremely expensive for the order I made plus the delivery fees are also pretty high on Deliveroo. The order never came and the driver lied about trying to get in contact with me. I have evidence on my phone of receiving no messages or calls from the delivery driver. I got in contact with customer service on their online chat and was told I was not entitled to any refund as the driver did try ring me. I pay for a service that’s so unreliable every single time and you are paying them for literally nothing and they can just take your money without being liable to refunding now. I don’t know how this is legal and on top of that the customer service agents are providing a horrible customer experience.",2023-03-07,Laura Hynes,N/A
Deliveroo,1,Stay away from this company,"Stay away from this company. I just recently have the same issue, the driver said that it came to the building and it was never of fron o the building. The security was there too except the driver. I should have read the comments in Truspilot before ordering. They are a shambles, and not willing to accept the responsibility.",2023-02-28,Salvador Rizo Lopez,N/A
Deliveroo,1,Even after being a regular customer for…,Even after being a regular customer for four years they decided to not issue a refund for a order that didn’t arrive.After filing a complaint to their customer support they did not give a clear response about why the order was not issued a refund even after asking for details several times. I guess the times have changed and they think it’s appropriate to let the customer take the hit for their shortcomings.,2023-02-26,Shourya Majumdar,N/A
