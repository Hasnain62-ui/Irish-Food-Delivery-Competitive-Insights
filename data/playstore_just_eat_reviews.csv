Just Eat,1,You cancelled our order after 1 hour waiting with no explanation or apology. Then we order from somewhere else and after 20 mins you now tell us the delivery is delayed until 10:30pm You then prevent us from cancelling the order because you will still still our money. You have no means of contacting support! I ordered at 7:30pm and will be lucky to get my dinner at 10:30pm because you won't let me cancel and go elsewhere.
