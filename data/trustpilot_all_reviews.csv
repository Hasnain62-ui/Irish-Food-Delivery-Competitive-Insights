Deliveroo,1,Absolute Disaster-Read Review if you need a laugh,"Today I ordered a delivery from M&S and it was not an experience I ever want to repeat. Firstly it took 2 hours to get from a store that is a 10 Minute drive away from my workplace. 2 Hours later I received an email from Deliveroo saying that their was an issue with my order so the Delivery driver had to go back to the store to get a new one. Still not sign of it until I got an email showing me a picture of where they had left my M&S food order because I wasnt answering the Door or my Calls (Totally untrue) . They delivered my Food Shopping to a ditch on the side of the road !!!! I Kid you not and what I am trying to get past is how the Delivery driver decided this was a real address. I have been burnt twice now by deliveroo, I wont be burnt a 3rd time. Disaster",2025-10-16,Suzanne,N/A

Deliveroo,1,The worst customer support,"An order was advertised as 20-30 mins delivery, arrives an hour and ten minutes later. Customer Support advised he would grant me credit, but the only credit I received was from the standard deliveroo plus ""on time"" guarantee. A ""Senior Agent"" was barely more helpful, just constant canned ""I'm sorry, your feedback will be taken on board"" and another small amount of credit. No explanations on the late order, no explanation on being mislead in the credit, I asked the SA to stop apologising and get me answers or a solution, so she kept apologising and telling me my feedback was important before deciding we were going in circles and ending the chat.",2025-10-06,Trevor,N/A
Deliveroo,1,No help! Very disappointing customer service! No point in website 😕,"I ordered of deliveroo and I just got false advertising off the menu on deliveroo, and I wouldn't have ordered it if the description didn't say it was a certain Item but it turned out to be a completely different item,  deliveroo wouldn't help me and there's no way to contact the restaurant so I've lost out and it's very disappointing! Like the whole point of this website is to deal with restaurants for you but instead I just got told to do it myself and I have no idea how to do that! I don't understand the point of this website when customer service doesn't even help at all! I should have got a refund straight away but instead I got them telling me to do it myself! Dissatisfied is an understatement! 🙄😒",2025-09-24,Amy,N/A

I said, ""Well, now you should tell Deliveroo that you did not finalize the delivery."" However, he put the code in and finalized it anyway. When I asked for a refund, they tried to contact him, and he refused to answer, so I got no refund and no food. They just don't care about real customers and let us get scammed by drivers. Totally unreliable company with ridiculous customer service and customer retention system.No explanation, no help, just automated replies and complete silence from customer service.

We treated them to a takeaway at their favourite chippy. After unpacking the food we noticed that one bag of chips was half empty and was 'closed' differently to the other 3. Very suspicious as our friends told us they always order there. Maybe that's why the delivery guy, clearly a migrant from the IPAS up the road, went off in a hurry.

All was good until I received my order as we sat down to enjoy our meal opened it and found out it was beef instead of chicken.rang zaytoon lady on the phone said she’ll send another order out. After 50 minutes called them again lady said she can’t send the order as delivroo refunded my account. Contacted delivroo online mentioned what’s wrong. After few minutes received a email saying they have refunded €22.40 out of €41.08. That’s when I decided to call them and ask what the story is . Man over the phone said you will only get 22.40 back as rest of your order was on discount. I told him I didn’t ask for discount when I was ordering . It’s simple as  I spent €41.08 on delivery I want all my money back. I asked him to put his supervisor on and told the supervisor if you don’t refund my money I’ll take you to court . It’s only then they refunded my money. Painful experience. Spoiled our evening. Spent 2 hours dealing with these incompetent people . I’ll never use them again.

The Rider left the dirty packet in front of the apartment and the food packets at the side of the apartment. The Rider had no civic sense, and presumably not aware that trash has to be disposed off at bin. Deliveroo has no control over these riders, in fact most of the riders name on system vs actual rider who is delivering doesn't match. This is in fact serious as Deliveroo will have no trail if something serious happens. A so called customer service manager by the name Carl couldn't not resolve the issue and said he is person with in charge and doesn't have anyone to escalate.

Deliveroo,1,Refused refund after not receiving my order!,"I wish I could give zero stars. I ordered food through Deliveroo on the weekend worth close to 50 euro. About an hour after the order was confirmed, about 9:40 PM, my food still didn't arrive, so I checked the website again for an update, I saw that my food, apparently, was delivered at 9:24 PM. I contacted support wondering what happened, and demanded a refund/credit (as the restaurant I ordered from had since closed). I was told the rider tried ringing me, couldn't get in contact so he left it on my doorstep. He did no such thing. I didn't receive any phone calls, and nothing was left on my door. I told them this, and I was told that because I wasn't available to take the calls, I was responsible for the cost. The rider never knocked on my door! He never even entered my property! I told them this, and when I was asked to confirm my address, I did, and I was told that the address I provided did not match the address the had on record (before I contacted support I had to confirm details the had for me during the 'review my case' part. One of the details was my address, and it was exactly my address!). I sent the manager (I spoke to three managers that night for close to 3 hours) a screenshot from my laptop of the section where they asked to confirm my address. I told him they did have the correct address, the same address I had just confirmed, and he again said it didn't match what they had on record and ended the chat. The insisted that the driver came to my address, didn't get an answer from the phone, left my order on the doorstep and left, and it was my responsibility and there would be no refund or credit. We have a Ring doorbell which detects motion and begins recording. No delivery rider came to my house. We also have CCTV, and when I checked that later, I saw a rider pulled up on the road outside a neighbours house, sat there for a few minutes and left with my food. He never once got off the bike. Apparently he tried to ring me, and because I didn't get his call I was responsible for the cost and no refund could be issued! The DELIVERY rider never came to my front door and knocked! Apparently, for what ever reason, if you don't answer/get their calls, they can just leave with your order, and it's your fault and you pay the cost. Apparently delivery rider/drivers don't have to knock on your door with your order. They gave me some nonsense about the riders being afraid to knock on doors because of babies or old people! I had a similar incident a week or two before where I was waiting on food, this time I checked the order sooner and saw someone was trying to ring me. I went to the door and saw the rider sitting there on his bike. Never thought to get off and knock (this was mid afternoon, too. So that nonsense about them being afraid to knock because of disturbing someone was pure bollox!). It could have been the same rider. I have never had this experience before where a DELIVERY driver/rider wouldn't knock on the door and then just left with my food! And then to be told it was my fault, and be refused a refund/credit was disgraceful! I'm taking this to their head office! Never use Deliveroo again! Use JustEat!",2025-01-07,Neil,N/A

Deliveroo,1,Ban Masked Deliveroo Riders/Abusive Intimidating Riders,"I am writing to raise a serious concern regarding the behavior of delivery drivers, which reflects a growing number of similar complaints found online. Earlier today, I was verbally abused, intimidated, and menaced by one of your e-scooter drivers as I was on my way home. Despite being in the privacy of my own vehicle, I was subjected to verbal assault. Naturally, I retaliated, as I will not tolerate being abused or verbally attacked by anyone while in my own car.This incident reflects a larger issue with delivery drivers acting irresponsibly on the road, creating unsafe and intimidating situations for other road users. The fact that many drivers are allowed to wear balaclavas or fully cover their faces while driving only heightens public discomfort and complicates accountability.For the safety of your drivers and the general public, I strongly urge your company to ban the use of balaclavas or face coverings by drivers while operating e-scooters, electric bikes, or any other vehicles. Drivers should also be held accountable for their conduct to ensure they follow legal and respectful behavior on the road.Addressing this ongoing issue and improving the conduct of your drivers is essential for the safety of road users and to uphold the reputation of your company. I expect a prompt response and immediate action to investigate this incident and prevent future occurrences.I have written a formal complaint also in anticipate Deliveroo's reply including an investigation. The abusive male driver who verbally attacked me, a petite woman in my own private vehicle whilst minding my own business is a danger and should be held accountable.",2024-09-18,Elanka Adamczyk,N/A

I definitely wouldn't have chosen a cyclist if I had an option. When he arrived, he was so angry about the distance between the restaurant and my home. He demanded money like a burglar covering his face with a black mask very aggressively. Ireland doesn't have a tipping culture like the US and why would anyone want to tip this person after being threatened by. I couldn't believe I had to experience this and their customer service just gave me genetic copy and paste messages, just couldn't care less.

I also think the company policy encourages them to do so.Any other reputable company like Ubereats has a solid message to the driver. If the guest does not receive and give you the security number in his application, it means your food has not been delivered.

Deliveroo,1,DO USE DELIVEROO,"DO NOT USE DELIVEROO, I ordered from mc Donald’s in lucan, the delivery driver too 1.5 hours delivering. He stood outside for 20 minutes and I got a call from DELIVEROO English number saying he was outside. I went out to get my food , his face was fully covered in a black mask. He shouted “ I need number before I give u food, being my 2nd time usin DELIVEROO I gave number because he wouldn’t give me food until I gave it to him. He was on his fone entering the number, I said where’s my food to be told it was delivered 30 minutes ago, I asked him y is he here if he has no food, and he acted like he couldn’t understand me, then he shouted u got food 30 minutes ago, you hv problem you ring McDonald s. I couldn’t understand why he was here if he had no food, so rang customer services and went through everything. I’m a single mother, and today is a treat day for my daughter, I don’t hv 25 euro to just waste, they were acting very understanding but insisted because I gave the delivery number , there’s no way I can get a refund. And explained in future do not give the number till u hv food in your hand. I went mad, it made no sense, because the guy refused to give me my food until I gave number, being new to the app I assumed that I’d naturally get my food. I used to use just eat but decided to use DELIVEROO to try them out with coupon codes( which by the way DONT WORK) so the girl put me through to complaint s. Another 40 minutes of I understand your upset and we don’t want you having this experience but because you gave the number we can’t refund u because it says u got your food. This guy was very sly, he acted like he couldn’t understand me to get onto DELIVEROO and speak perfect English. I was so upset because I genuinely Dnt hv that money to just waste so I drove up to the mc Donald’s who I got the food from. Ask for a manager and explained what happened, she was amazing and remembered the guy coming in for the order, she only remembered him because he had a full face head mask and he just stood out. They have nothing to do with DELIVEROO just put the orders through.!I was so mad I just wanted to let them know , to take note and that’s all, I wasn’t expecting food or money, she said look I’m so mad for you and I’m so sorry that happened, do you want some food, I said oh no I’m not here for that it’s just principle, she said she completely understood and has experienced bad delivery with DELIVEROO, I lost my appetite by this point but I ordered a cheese burger and chips nd drink for my daughter. She said do u want anything else because it was 25 euro, she was so kind and understanding. I was so impressed, they could hv just taken note but she knew the feeling of loosing money nd no food for DELIVEROO. I hv to say the way the driver acted nd the response from DELIVEROO it’s just a horrible service, no other place used numbers to give to delivery driver so they obviously have had a problem with ppl not delivering food and just saying it, he obviously took my food and gave it away and seen I was only new so he put on the act to get the number. I should hv taken a video of him saying that my food was delivered by someone else but he needed the number of me regardless.

They refunded me less than it would now cost me to get that second drink on the deliveroo app on KFC (where order was placed). When I contacted the customer service and asked them to make it right they said there's nothing they can do as refund was system generated. So instead of just crediting me the difference or getting the driver to bring a second drink they just said sorry they will take my feedback for the future. I told the customer service agent they didn't help resolve and that I won't be using deliveroo again, all agent said was sorry to hear. Ever wonder how to lose business....this right here is it, very much a ""don't care attitude"", they would rather not make it right, when Deliveroos revenue is down and they wonder why ,it's because of things like this, it's the principal of doing right by those that you need to operate your business( DELIVEROO NEEDS TO REALISE THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY DELIVERY SERVICE OUT THERE). I refuse to use deliveroo again.",2023-10-14,Pharen Pillai,N/A

Deliveroo,1,where’s my food gone 🤔,Me and my massive family with babies and my wife ordered some food for our dinner and when the ‘food’ arrived there was none! It only came with 2 drinks and ice creams by this i am really appalled on this vile behaviour my children are crying thinking they won’t be able to eat and was looking forward to this exciting treat as we rarely order. I seriously think this needs sorting out as money has been wasted and time. Even more so this isn’t the first time this has happened it isn’t ok 👎 i do not recommend deliveroo at all as i’m sick to my stomach with stress from how poor the customer service is not even being able to call them to ask for the food to get delivered or even a refund. Do better deliveroo i’m not impressed. 👿👿👿👿😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬👎👎👎,2023-09-14,lucia tompkinson,N/A
Deliveroo,1,Absolute rip off,Driver made no attempt to deliver. We were all home. Got a message to say food was left in the garden - it wasn’t. Contacted them and they said the driver would not return and I wasn’t eligible for a refund because they had attempted to deliver. Restaurant won’t engage as they are a third party supplier. So I literally just gave them money for nothing and they spoiled a family birthday dinner. Live chat support was incredibly unhelpful.,2023-09-13,Maria Mcnally,N/A

I asked for a refund but he didn't understand me so we spent 15 mins speaking into an app trying to translate back and forth to each other. He took a photo of the food he had dropped on the ground as evidence for Deliveroo that the order was not delivered. However, I never received a refund. I contacted deliveroo and waited ages for them to reply. They told me that I needed a photo of the food on the ground as proof. At this stage the food was already in the bin. I asked if they could contact the driver as he had a photo, but they said they had no way of knowing who delivered the food. I won't be using them again",2023-08-25,Lilly Shield,N/A

Deliveroo,1,Appalling customer service & scamming money from my debit card.,"I have never left a bad review in my life but just felt like people had to be warned with how appalling their customer service is. I have never had a worse experience. I have never had a deliveroo account and I haven't ordered from the site but it came to my attention that there was a charge for Deliveroo plus on my debit card. I thought this might be a mistake as a result of my amazon prime account which you can activate a free deliveroo plus membership with ( i never did ). I rang the customer service number where i was told they can see the transactions made on my card and that it is not coming from my deliveroo account, however they couldn't disclose the email address of the person making the transaction as the ""data isn't related to me personally."" Right. So they could see that the transactions were fraudulent and i was told , which i have in writing in an email, that there would be a temporary hold on my card while it was investigated further by their financial team. This was the 7th of july of this month and yet another deliveroo plus charge was placed on my card 31st of July. I rang the same support number again and was talking to the same woman as before but this time was told i have to email the support email address because it's out of her hands. So i emailed this email address and as someone else said in their review , i was met with generic / automatic responses and every single time i replied with details they asked for it was someone else replying. Over three days i had 7 if not more different people reply when i would reply to one of their emails and each time the person would be uneducated on the situation and ask for the same details again. When i first saw the transaction for deliveroo plus i was immediately going to cancel my card but seen as the only transactions on my card that were not my own was for deliveroo plus i didn't because as i said above i was told that any future payments for deliveroo with my card would be blocked as they know they are fraudulent and yet i was still charged a second time. I currently have my card frozen because i'm a 3rd level student and don't want any more money taken , they customer service team is an absolute joke , all i want is my refund for at least the second transaction if not both and then i will cancel my card because they won't refund it if my card is different . Everyone who is saying that they are a scam is 100%, they will do absolutely anything to avoid refunds and it seems deliberate that they reply with a new person every time. I will never ever use deliveroo.",2023-08-06,sarah _,N/A

I was so shocked at this that I told him he was a rude person, I went back to my house and he came back over and started kicking in my front door.

Deliveroo,1,Disgraceful Handling from their Support Team,Our cyclist was pulling into our estate so I decided to go down to meet him. When I got there he did not speak any English and gave our food away to another lady living in our apartment complex without asking for the code. The only way he could know if it was me was through the code because he could not understand simple English. So I provided him the code so he would know it was for me. He then proceeded to cycle away in a panic saying he does not speak english. I complained to the support department about the incident and they will not help because the code was given.

I complained as normal through the app and got a credit for the missing items but no formal apology. I then went on help again and asked for the tip I had provided to be taken back of the rider. Seemingly this is impossible. I got some nonsense that they would use to improve blah blah blah. What I fail to understand is why Deliveroo continue to have confidence in their management team in Ireland. They have obviously never heard of customer experience or would be reading these reviews and trying to rectify the issues they have. What makes it worse is that I actually hold shares in Deliveroo from when they launched on UK stock market. No wonder they don’t make money. Think the only sensible thing is to write to the outlets they deliver for and ask that they maybe sign with another delivery company.,2023-05-12,Rob Walsh,N/A

Contacted the support which you can't ring and sort straight away. It is just a chat function that will order an investigation for a refund that can take up to 48 hours. This does not help when you have waited an hour and half for food. Contact the resturant and they said are food was picked up by driver so either driver took are food or dropped it off somewhere else. No solution from there support would never use them again.

Deliveroo,1,No call. No Knock. €63 Takeaway and Wine stolen by Driver,"No call. No knock. Logged into my online account on my PC to find it was ""delivered' 15 mins ago. Restaurant referred me to Deliveroo support. Despite not having app, rider supposedly sent me loads of app notifications he was outside. I sent screenshots of both my phone notifications and emails from Deliveroo to show this to be false. The front door is 3m from the street, but no knock. No call. Support say no refund and no I can't have proof he was ever in the area. I know what happened. He saw the order contained a luxury €63 takeaway including a bottle of wine from a very nice Japanese restaurant called Osaka in Cork City Centre and said, 'Oh that's nice, I'll rob the customer and Deliveroo will cover my tracks for me'. Don't order from these thieves",2023-03-14,Laura H,N/A
Deliveroo,1,Simply a fraud,"Simple - nobody ever showed up to our door but the app marked our order as delivered.We immediately contacted the customer service who simply confirmed the system information: ""Order delivered"".We pointed out that we were at home, lights on and all, why would anybody deliver food on a driveway without even making a call, nevermind knocking at a very accessible door?Nothing, ""our system reports that the order has been delivered"".Not only a fraud of a rider (hope you enjoyed our dinner, bro), but a fraud of a company, totally incapable of guaranteeing a minimum of service (and frankly, of sense).Unless you are truly desperate, stay away from Deliveroo.

He ignored that, complained about the rain and then presumably dumped the food somewhere. I went to the livechat app for a refund and they refused because the rider said he had delivered.

I recently had an accident with my hand so am unable to cook or use my wheelchair the last two weeks, so besides my lovely mam cooking for me was relying on this takeaway that day. The order was also extremely expensive for the order I made plus the delivery fees are also pretty high on Deliveroo. The order never came and the driver lied about trying to get in contact with me. I have evidence on my phone of receiving no messages or calls from the delivery driver. I got in contact with customer service on their online chat and was told I was not entitled to any refund as the driver did try ring me. I pay for a service that’s so unreliable every single time and you are paying them for literally nothing and they can just take your money without being liable to refunding now.

My food was not delivered, yet the delivery person claimed it was. Who gave him the delivery code? This is my second experience like this. It feels like this guy is stealing food and falsely claiming it was delivered. I called customer service, and the representative was empathetic, promising a refund within 10 days. I've lost €50 to this company twice. Many say they are good, but it seems I'm unlucky for the second time. It's unfair; you work so hard, and then someone messes with your food...if I get my money back, I will delete the app from my phone and never use again and warn people in my office at the IFSC to stay clear of this folks, they dont get it right...lucky are those that have good to say, stuck eating digestive biscuits with a cup of coffee after losing €25",2025-05-03,Olumuyiwa,N/A

I was not contacted by the driver and the doorbell never rang.When I contacted customer service (their is no number to call, just message), I asked them to deliver it again, but they told me they couldn't because it was marked 'delivered', total nonsense. My food didn't arrive, contact another of your drivers to get it done, straightforward as that! A refund was issued supposedly (though was told it would take 5 - 7 days to get it, so I still need to check), but it's absurd that such a straightforward job could not be done, while I'm waiting, absolutely hunger!!I was offered a €15 voucher as a, so called, apology, however I said if they were really sorry they'd send the €15 to my bank account, of course they wouldn't.

I found out that the reason why your food order delays it’s due to Uber asking drivers to pick up more orders at the same time, and if they declined, Uber will cancel their accounts. However, if you want your order deliver on time, you must pay extra charge. This is in addition to service charges, menu’s price increases through Uber, and last but not least the tip.

I reported the Dip missing, the it wouldn't let me report the food as they had give me 22 pence as a refund, less than 1% of the whole order which was inedible.

Uber Eats,1,Always Cold Food and Illegal Delivery Drivers,"I'm writing this review to add to the numerous negative posts here so that either UberEats change their ways or some people can join me in taking legal action and raise awareness.The issues span various topics but my most recent is also the most common. You order hot takeaway food. The driver picks up (late), the driver takes forwever, goes the wrong way / gets lost / is doing other jobs for other delivery apps and then when the food arrives it is usually cold and missing items.UberEats do not refund under any circumstances. This time the reason was that they don't refund on personal preference - my hot food arrived freezing cold, not personal preference. Another issue, which probably contributes to their problems is the frequency of drivers that turn up who are not the designated driver and are most likely illegal immigrants. I will not use this app again, I urge everyone to move on from it and if anyone is interested in taking legal action to gain wider attention then please do let me know.",2025-10-15,Dean,N/A

I had previously canceled my membership in August because Uber Eats isn’t available in Drumheller, Alberta, where I live. Despite canceling, I was charged again.When I asked for a refund, Cris told me I couldn’t get one because I had already been refunded in August. That makes no sense — if I canceled and wasn’t using the service, why was I charged again?To make matters worse, Cris called me “sentimental” during the chat, which I found disrespectful and inappropriate. I’m now in Toronto for Thanksgiving, where Uber services are available, but I wasn’t able to use my membership when I needed it most — and Uber refuses to refund me for the time I couldn’t use it.This kind of treatment is unacceptable.

I will wait for a couple of days if they will refund me, I took photos of the items I received and then contact again.

I contacted support several times—chat, email, and phone—but no one could help.As a first-time user, this was incredibly frustrating and disheartening. No one sick and relying on delivery should be left without help. Uber Eats should make it easier to correct simple address errors and provide real support when it’s needed most.",2025-10-12,Saranette W.,N/A

I even tried contacting them through email, the help page, and their so-called “support link,” but it just takes me back to the same dead end.It honestly feels like they’ve set up the system to block you from speaking to anyone when you have a legitimate complaint. Absolutely disgraceful customer service. If you get bad food, expect zero help and no refund.I’ll be reporting this to Trading Standards, Resolver, and Consumer Rights because this kind of service is unacceptable.",2025-10-12,Consumer,N/A

Uber Eats,1,Thieves,Thieves! We ordered some groceries from  and didn't receive an item we contacted the help online. But apparently as we have had a bad run with items not available so the total has been lowered or refunded. Or we have had items missing. Then they will not refund us! In my eyes that calling us untrustworthy/ scammers. When all we have done is not have items available so either automatically had a refund  or asked for a refund if something was missing that was hardly at all and our fault!! It wasn't expensive but if you don't receive something on any normal shop you would get your money back. Not be treated like that. Would close the account but unfortunately I use Uber cars  to get to the hospital when needed. Wouldn't mind so much if we had a little bit money. But like the lady in the shop where the order came from (phone the shop first to see if they could help)  said it's the principle.Be aware.

He also ended the cat abruptly saying there was nothing he could do. For the price that I paid in delivery fees the least they could do was apologise and nit one of the three agents I chatted with did so until I pointed it out.

Uber Eats,1,Do not use Uber eats. They will knowingly charge you missed items,"My latest screw up on Uber eats.........This explains my recent delivery and a couple previous deliveries and Uber's latest response.The driver said he had to take the scotch back as well as forgetting the wine to fix the order. We had a conversation and decided he would complete the order through the app, then go back to the store and get the wine. Support called me soon after and informed me he ""dropped off the wine and left it outside"". That would have been impossible because a round trip back to the store would have taken a minimum of 45 minutes.You know this. I was friendly and understanding. He lied to you. He lied to me and ripped me off. I trusted him and he screwed me. Oh and I tipped him for the experience as well.Now you are doing the same. 2 wrongs don't make a right.You have refunded me before for frankly horrible behavior by your employees. I assumed you would do the same this time. That's why after talking to John I said I would reorder the wine and let Uber fix it later. One time a driver assaulted me by ripping my ID out of hand and was aggressive throughout the encounter. Another accused me of assault when all I did was keep an order I paid for and provided my driver's license as asked. Your app failed to ok the picture and he decided to shove me aside to retrieve the package. I was so floored all I did was stand in his way thinking ""is this really happening?"" Moments later I told him he was trespassing and to leave immediately which he DIDN'T do. I don't normally turn to violence but I would have been in my rights to physically remove him. He AND phone support tried accusing ME of assault and would be contacting the police. I called the none emergency number and found they didn't follow through on the threat.So I have had to endure 2 assaults, been ACCUSED of assault once and now one theft. Make no mistake, by knowingly charging me for a product I didn't receive IS theft.I will be talking to the store manager on Friday and see if they are willing to reimburse me the $83 for the second order. In fact John already told me I can pick up a box of wine no charge. He also said he would have driven it out to me that night but he was the only one at the store. My experience with Uber has been a complete disaster to say the least. Just because you have refunded me in the past doesn't mean you can steal from me now.I'm taking this matter to the BBB. They can't do much but it will get your behavior out of the public. I will contact the city and see what can be done about your business license. I have multiple cameras all around my house. This has all been recorded. I wasn't going to involve the police but will now about everything to date. This is a theft. Perhaps a lawsuit is in the near future? You and your employees can't do this to people without repercussions. I will do everything I can and tell anyone who listens about your bizarre company behavior. You didn't even offer a free box of wine in place of a refund.Ubers response:We can confirm that this order isn’t eligible for a refund or price adjustment.Thank you for your understanding.",2025-10-09,D D,N/A

Uber Eats,1,1 out 6 drivers recommended.,"My recent UberEATS experience was absolutely disappointing. The first driver showed up at the restaurant, picked up my order — and then disappeared. After that, I saw driver after driver (five in total!) get assigned to my order, go to the restaurant, and then drop it. I assumed maybe the food wasn’t ready.Finally, the sixth driver called me and explained that the first driver had already taken the food — and every other driver had been told the same thing at the restaurant. Yet none of them reported it or tried to follow up, until the last person. So out of six drivers, only one actually cared enough to make a call and explain what was going on.The first driver essentially stole my food, and the others just didn’t bother. It’s not just about being left hanging — it’s the complete lack of accountability and communication, not just toward customers, but between UberEATS drivers themselves.To make it worse, when I contacted customer support to cancel the order, they weren’t apologetic or even surprised. No effort to understand what happened — just generic, canned responses, like this kind of situation is completely normal. Then they told me, “Good news! We can cancel your order without a cancellation fee. Just order again!”Umm… no thanks. Uninstalling Uber.",2025-10-08,Scott,N/A
Uber Eats,1,Refused refund for undelivered order — I’ve uninstalled Uber for good,"My Uber Eats order (LKR 5,898.62) was never delivered, yet Uber refused to refund it — hiding behind a “48-hour policy”. That policy might suit Uber’s internal systems, but it doesn’t override consumer law: when goods aren’t delivered, customers are entitled to a refund.To make matters worse, every time I replied through the app, the case was automatically marked “resolved” — no human ever reviewed it. The entire experience shows how unhelpful and impersonal their customer service has become.It’s not just Uber Eats. On the rides side, my last trip to Heathrow cost £95.97, while a local cab company quoted £72 for the same journey — in a newer, cleaner vehicle.After this, I’ve uninstalled Uber for good — and I’d genuinely encourage others to do the same until Uber starts respecting its customers and basic consumer-rights standards.",2025-10-08,Prasanna,N/A

My last delivery driver told me to talk to customer service and report it as stolen. I spoke with two customer service representatives and they kept saying well you wasn't charged  we refunded you for your order. I told them thats not the issue. The issue is that uber eats allows thieves to work for them. I don't feel safe doing business with a company who doesn't have values, morals or principles. They allow their workers to steal. They should be held accountable and fired. If you continue to let employees get away with theft with no consequences they will continue to do so. I have been a faithful customer for years. As of today I am no longer patronizing this company. I stuck with them even when I was done wrong in the past but not this time. I'm done. I will take my business elsewhere because Uber doesn't value their customers. Door dash would never allow this the driver would have been investigated and held accountable. All they had to do was call the restaurant and asks who picked my order up but uber made it crystal clear that they don't care. Neither do I. I'm done I feel disrespected",2025-10-08,Nandi Washington,N/A
Uber Eats,1,Food damaged and UberEATS don't care!,Food arrived and it was a mess - all the dishes had leaked out.  The driver stood at the door and kept saying it was the restaurants fault (swearing a lot) and that I needed to contact them. I got in touch with UberEATS who only allow you to upload one picture. This didn't show the full extent of the damage.  They refunded me for one dish and closed the case. I tried to complain again and the fobbed me off.  Disgusting non-existant customer service and I am out nearly £70 because the food was inedible and damaged because of them,2025-10-07,Anon,N/A
Uber Eats,1,They HATE their customers and support is worhtless,"They will always side with the merchant. Regardless of if the merchant has cancelled 10 orders in a row for no reason (across several weeks time and different times during the day), or they just failed to send you items. The support team does not understand english, and will only paste canned answers that do not match the details you're providing. This company does not care about it's customers in the slightest. They only care about taking care of their merchants and screwing you out of money. Everything they do is set up to steal from you. Check those prices they charge, it's a crazy high mark up. Not obviously this is a business and we need to make money too, but like wild mark ups that the merchants don't charge for (requiring you to add toppings to pizza that state it is included but then charge you $3 per topping lol) It's crazy to me how it is legal for them to operate the way they do. Only in America where capitalism is GOD is this allowed. The support and company are trash thieves and I will spend the rest of my life making sure everyone knows until they are no longer allowed to steal from people.",2025-10-07,Grumpy Comet,N/A
Uber Eats,1,How to make money without worrying about your customers.,"Uber Eats prides itself on slow service, delivering cold food, along with the occasional wrong order just to make things exciting. They love their delivery people placing the order right up against your front door so you have to knock it over to get to it. Another service they offer is the impossibility of contacting anyone to make an enquiry or to complain. They probably can't pay anyone enough to handle complaint after complaint.",2025-10-07,WayS,N/A
Uber Eats,1,I’ve had uber eats for a long time,"I’ve had uber eats for a long time. I even upgraded to UberOne. The amount of actual time I’ve lost is sickening. In my last 10 orders I’ve had 4 orders get cancelled either due to the driver stealing the food or the driver cancelling after I’ve already waited for the food for over an hour. Now this isn’t Ubereats fault but the way they handle it is awful. All they do is refund your order as if that’s fixed the problem from your end. They should be offering better support and refunds or offers for the time I’ve lost as a customer. And don’t get me started on the prices and all the extra charges. It’s better if you just order direct from the restaurant, use Ubereats as an Argos catalogue and go direct.",2025-10-07,Zehn,N/A

Uber Eats,1,The Diabolical Customer Support Maze,"My final Uber Eats order was an absolute disaster. The food was ready less than 30 minutes after I placed it, then sat on the counter for over an hour while drivers were assigned, cancelled, reassigned, and cancelled again. The ETA kept shifting until the food finally arrived nearly two hours later, cold, soggy, and inedible. It went straight in the bin.Customer service offered a templated apology, some vague promise to ‘review ETAs,’ and a £3 refund on a £20 order. When I asked for a proper refund (minus the rider’s tip, since it wasn’t their fault), they declared the matter closed. Basically, I am being penalised for their service failure. Reaching support felt like wandering through labyrinth land, forms, delays, dead ends. It’s remarkable how easy it is for them to take your money, and how impossibly difficult it is to reach a human when things go wrong. Also, what is the deal with these awfully written templates they're using to deal with complaints? After years as a paying subscriber and frequent customer, I’ve closed my account. Uber Eats clearly doesn’t value loyalty or basic service standards. If they can’t deliver a meal within reasonable time or provide a decent response, then what is the point continuing being a customer?",2025-10-07,BettyLou,N/A

Uber Eats,1,If I could give it 0 stars I would,"If I could give it 0 stars I would. I’ve had a couple of issues with UberEats now and will never use them again. Previously I ordered food and when it arrived there were two items missing. I let UberEats know and there response was that it had been reviewed but on this occasion they couldn’t offer a refund. I asked them to explain why, and how they made this ridiculous decision but they couldn’t. Appalling given I paid for something, didn’t receive it and then could do absolutely nothing about it. I ended up calling the restaurant and explained the situation and they kindly helped me. It happened again on Monday, after months of avoiding the app I chose to try again. The food was delivered an hour after placing the order, the delivery driver took approx. 40 mins to do a 15 min journey as they were on a bike and had multiple stops along the way. Of course my food arrived stone cold. It was inedible and a complete waste of money. It’s not rocket science that it would be cold after such a ridiculous delivery process. I complained and offered feedback to UberEats that this system doesn’t work. They ignored me, sending an automated reply 4 times. I finally had a response from a human saying again that they’d reviewed this but couldn’t give me a refund on this occasion. They just don’t care, their customer service is non existent and I would avoid like the plague.",2025-10-07,Emily,N/A

Uber Eats,1,Ubereats se moque gentiment de vous,"Bonsoir à tous les lecteurs.J’ai reçu ce matin un offre promotionnelle de Uber eats que j’use très rarement. J’ai fait une commande le soir même, mais le code promotionnel ne fonctionnait pas. Ma commande est de plus arrivée 45mn trop tôt (nous avons mangé avant 19h). Jai donc écrit sur le site ubereats pour signaler le non fonctionnement du code. La réponse est originale : je ne fais pas partie du groupe pouvant bénéficier de la promotion. Donc, si je comprends bien, ubereats vous envoie des promotion sur votre boîte email personnelle, mais ce n’est pas pour vous.Voici ma réponse :Thanks for your answer. So, if I understand correctly, you sent on my private email this very day a promotion, and when I let you know that I couldn’t use it, you answer is “you were not part of this “selected” group. It’s like someone calling you on your mobile phone, using your mobile phone number, but saying “I’m not speaking to you”. Original. I think that I won’t use anymore uber eats or uber in general at all, as you are making fun about your clients. Next uber email will be be “blocked” and send directly to junk, and I will tell this funny story to any friends or colleagues : if uber send you an offer on your email address, careful, maybe it’s not for you.

Uber Eats,1,Horrible customer service,"We are on a small vacation in Gdansk, Poland. Last night we ordered two pizzas from Felino pizza in Gdansk. We ordered at 23.35, and the receipt said we should have the food delivered between 00.20 and 00.40. 0.54 am I called the pizza place, asking how much longer. They didnt speak english, so that didnt help. At 1.30 we left the hotel to find something to eat, as we were starving. About the same time, the pizza place called, again no english. I said we no longer wanted the food, as we had been waiting two hours from ordering. They still marked the food as delivered tho, at 2.35 am - even though we never received anything. Complaining to Uber eats didnt help at all, they just claim Im not eligible for a refund. I dont care about the money, its pocket change. I do care about being ripped off tho.

Uber Eats,1,Review for Uber Eats Canada,"I’ve had two separate orders through Uber Eats that were never fulfilled, yet I was charged in full.One store (Kingsway) kept delaying delivery for nearly two hours without ever assigning a driver. Another (Team C on W Broadway) called me to say my item was out of stock and couldn’t fulfill the order. In both cases, Uber charged me, claiming the stores had already “started preparing” the orders — even though no delivery ever happened.I contacted support multiple times, but they hid behind automated responses instead of resolving the issue. Uber’s policy of charging customers for undelivered or unavailable orders is completely unacceptable and violates basic consumer protection standards.I’ve filed a complaint with Consumer Protection BC and would strongly advise others to be cautious using Uber Eats for cannabis or non-food orders.",2025-10-04,Cynthia,N/A
Uber Eats,2,Service is no longer important,"The experience on UberEats has sadly completely deteriorated in recent months.

This went on for close to 1.5/2 hours before they finally paid attention. More recently, they couldn’t find a courier, so by the time the food finally arrived it was stone cold. On a £40 inedible order they refunded £7. When I asked for a justification they just sent me an automated response saying it had already been refunded therefore the issue was resolved. I’ve had a great relationship with Uber/UberEats for years, but its like they really don’t care anymore. Loyalty isn’t rewarded, support are passive aggressive and service is as bad as I have received anywhere.

When attempting to submit a complaint, I noticed there were separate categories, one for missing items and another for damaged food, etc. I first selected the option for the missing item (the soft drink). However, I was then unable to file an additional complaint for the damaged food, as the system indicated that I already had an active complaint and needed to wait.That complaint has since been resolved, and I received a refund for the soft drink.

I asked for the terms and conditions that state this and asked for a complaints e-mail and they closed my chat, as said they can't help. I never leave bad reviews but the fact I had already spoken to someone on the day my order was cancelled, who failed to mention I would actually need to make contact again within 48hrs (even though I was on the chat at the time of cancellation so why couldn't they have started the process then?) is a bit of a joke.

Uber Eats,1,Incompetent Company,"There have been many times I have ordered from Uber Eats. Every time they have either delivered to wrong address or stolen orders. When I order with any other delivery service, the items are incorrect but not reflectant on the company. In this case I am going to call out my delivery person Alexander S. This person took 1.5 hours to pick up my food, and call it delivered but the food was not at my door. Strong suspicion that this person ate my order. I do not buy food for drivers to eat. Uber Eats makes it impossible to file complaints by removing the customer service phone number and requiring you to create an account with no way that I can find to file a complaint. I have never dealty with a company so disrespectful to their customers and hire people that are highly incompetent at delivering orders, possibly even stealing it. I will NEVER, use Uber Eats or its subsideries if this is the kind of support they offer their customers. Highly unsatisfactory and ill managed.",2025-10-04,Jay,N/A

I ordered the food and snacks and booze we would be having and was informed that it would arrive at 1810 that evening. The order then changed to arriving at 1835 and then to 1905. When I looked to find out if it was on time at 1850 it informed me it had been cancelled with no explanation!!  YOU CANNOT TRUST THIS SERVICE. HOW CAN THEY LET YOU DOWN WITH 15 MINS TO DELIVERY. MY EVENING WAS RUINED. I HAVE CANCELLED MY ACCOUNT AND WILL NEVER USE AGAIN. DISGRACEFUL!!!,2025-10-03,Gail Penrice,N/A
Uber Eats,1,S***e company,Crap business. Never got the delivery. Driver lied and said he waited for nine minutes but no one came. Driver sent a “photo” of delivery place but the photo was nothing but white space! No way to actually speak to anyone about this and after we submitted our report of the non delivery we were told the issue had been resolved and the driver acted within acceptable procedures. Bunch of BS! Will never EVER use UberEats again. £54.00 down the drain to this farce of a company!,2025-10-03,Paul Rider,N/A

Tried to cancel and option only appeared after the shop had accepted meaning I couldn't get a refund. Explained this to the agent and could tell they either weren't reading the messages or was a AI/scripted response. Malicious website design along with bad customer service.

For 3-4 seconds!!!! They don’t listen you, don’t understand you at all!! They just hang up or end the chat without any solution or explanation. Just ends the chat after few automatic messages!!!

Yes, SmashBurger Bath. Now I can say for sure that there is a problem with the restaurant. As I ordered at around 17.35 and the order went to being “prepared” straight away. Then it was picked up really quickly as well. So it’s really odd that it came freezing cold. Also ,  another strange thing about the delivery. The guy who delivered to me was able to understand my very particular direction to my house perfectly  . Yet he wasn’t able to understand a 4 digit code.

Uber Eats,1,They didnt reply or help with my issue.,"I’m following up on a previous issue I raised regarding an order I placed with DIA Supermarket. In that order, four different drivers were listed as delivering my items. Two of them actually delivered part of the order, while the other two showed up, took a photo, and left without delivering anything.As a result, several items were missing from the order. I had already reported this and was told the issue would be looked into, but the ticket was closed without resolution.I want to express how uncomfortable and concerning this experience was—having multiple drivers show up at different times, including after some items were already delivered. It felt disorganized and unsettling, especially with some drivers not delivering anything but still marking the order as completed.Given the incomplete delivery and the inconvenience caused, I’m requesting a full refund for this order. Please review this matter again and let me know how it will be resolved.Thank you,",2025-10-02,PokeShop,N/A
Uber Eats,1,Worst Company Experience – Robbed by Uber,"will never use Uber again. I ordered through their app, cancelled within one minute, and yet 30 minutes later they still charged me. I called customer support, and they told me it was “policy” and that nothing could be done. I called the store directly, and they confirmed it was Uber’s fault.In the end, I was robbed of $40 with no solution, no accountability, and a customer service rep who seemed perfectly fine with that outcome. This is the worst company I’ve ever dealt with.I’ve deleted every Uber app from my phone, and I will never use them again.

Uber Eats,1,I will never use Uber again!,"I will never use Uber again! It's one thing that the driver delivered my order to the wrong address and when I called him right away, he didn't want to go back and get it... but said he'd issue a credit to me. He didn't do that so I went through the customer service bot on the app the next day AND the following day. Twice reported to customer service!  The second time the bot said my issue was already resolved which it wasn't, so I restated the promise to credit my order. Nothing and zero response back to me. I get it some drivers aren't going to care about giving good service. I was able to zero out his tip. But the COMPANY has NO customer service. My order was not only not credited but the delivery fee remained! ANY company that can't take care of a customer's problem with their driver is of no use to me EVER for any of their services. Even a bot can be programmed to give a response and forward situations, that don't fit its programming, to a person with a brain. Never ever again...",2025-10-01,Connie,N/A

When I spoke with the delivery driver, he was quite rude and didn’t offer any help, more focused on rushing to his next delivery. He also pressured me into giving him the delivery code and didn’t provide any assistance.When I contacted Uber Eats, I faced extremely unhelpful and rude customer service. They initially doubted my claim, and even after I provided a screenshot of the order button showing the deal, they dismissed my complaint on a technicality. They claimed that because I didn’t take a photo of the food upon delivery, they couldn’t verify my issue.While I understand some policies, this experience really shows how little Uber Eats values customer satisfaction.

I'm absolutely shocked and really angry. I'm going to start using Deliveroo or Just Eat. I paid about £80 for a year's membership so again I've wasted money with that. I honestly can't believe how badly this particular service was.
