Uber Eats,1,Charged for what you order. What you get is a headache. No refunds,"I ordered several things. The store only had 1 of them. I gave a tip and was charged delivery based on the total price. The driver didn’t speak either English or Spanish. I wound up paying $44 for a $9 item and giving a $9 tip. Multiple messages to customer service yielded nothing. This service is deeply flawed. You’re billed for what you order, not what you recieve.",2025-10-19,cree lawson,N/A
Uber Eats,1,Rubbish service,"Very disappointing experience. My order was never delivered, and there was no way to contact anyone for help. I called the restaurant (Arome Bradford), and they said the driver is an older Uber driver who comes there often, so I should get in touch with Uber Eats — but they weren’t helpful at all. Overall, a terrible experience and not even worth 1 star.",2025-10-18,Customer,N/A
Uber Eats,1,30 minutes late breakfast but Uber eats still gets paid,Ordered breakfast and driver had one stop before delivering mine. This is fine but 20 minutes later my food still wasn’t here so I cancelled my order knowing that the eggs are probably gonna be cold.

Uber Eats,1,Uber Eats getting greedy and worst than ever,"Uber Eats it’s getting more and more greedy and worst customer experience by the minute. I found out that the reason why your food order delays it’s due to Uber asking drivers to pick up more orders at the same time, and if they declined, Uber will cancel their accounts. However, if you want your order deliver on time, you must pay extra charge. This is in addition to service charges, menu’s price increases through Uber, and last but not least the tip.

I reported the Dip missing, the it wouldn't let me report the food as they had give me 22 pence as a refund, less than 1% of the whole order which was inedible.  The phone help line just sends you a link and brings you back around to the website which doesn't want to know as I had a 22p refund and that means I lose my statutory rights according to Uber, no way of phoning or emailing and shut off by the website.

Uber Eats,1,Always Cold Food and Illegal Delivery Drivers,"I'm writing this review to add to the numerous negative posts here so that either UberEats change their ways or some people can join me in taking legal action and raise awareness.The issues span various topics but my most recent is also the most common. You order hot takeaway food. The driver picks up (late), the driver takes forwever, goes the wrong way / gets lost / is doing other jobs for other delivery apps and then when the food arrives it is usually cold and missing items.UberEats do not refund under any circumstances. This time the reason was that they don't refund on personal preference - my hot food arrived freezing cold, not personal preference. Another issue, which probably contributes to their problems is the frequency of drivers that turn up who are not the designated driver and are most likely illegal immigrants. I will not use this app again, I urge everyone to move on from it and if anyone is interested in taking legal action to gain wider attention then please do let me know.",2025-10-15,Dean,N/A

Uber Eats,1,Uber One Membership Charged After…,"Uber One Membership Charged After Cancellation — Poor Customer Service ExperienceOn October 14 at 6pm, I spoke with a customer service agent named Cris regarding an Uber One membership charge. I had previously canceled my membership in August because Uber Eats isn’t available in Drumheller, Alberta, where I live. Despite canceling, I was charged again.When I asked for a refund, Cris told me I couldn’t get one because I had already been refunded in August. That makes no sense — if I canceled and wasn’t using the service, why was I charged again?To make matters worse, Cris called me “sentimental” during the chat, which I found disrespectful and inappropriate. I’m now in Toronto for Thanksgiving, where Uber services are available, but I wasn’t able to use my membership when I needed it most — and Uber refuses to refund me for the time I couldn’t use it.This kind of treatment is unacceptable.

I will wait for a couple of days if they will refund me, I took photos of the items I received and then contact again.

Uber Eats,1,Thieves,Thieves! We ordered some groceries from  and didn't receive an item we contacted the help online. But apparently as we have had a bad run with items not available so the total has been lowered or refunded. Or we have had items missing. Then they will not refund us! In my eyes that calling us untrustworthy/ scammers. When all we have done is not have items available so either automatically had a refund  or asked for a refund if something was missing that was hardly at all and our fault!! It wasn't expensive but if you don't receive something on any normal shop you would get your money back. Not be treated like that. Would close the account but unfortunately I use Uber cars  to get to the hospital when needed. Wouldn't mind so much if we had a little bit money. But like the lady in the shop where the order came from (phone the shop first to see if they could help)  said it's the principle.Be aware.

He also ended the cat abruptly saying there was nothing he could do. For the price that I paid in delivery fees the least they could do was apologise and nit one of the three agents I chatted with did so until I pointed it out. They made a big show of blaming macdonalds for the issue and took no responsibility for their rude staff. Cancelling my app and jumping in my car next time.

Uber Eats,1,Do not use Uber eats. They will knowingly charge you missed items,"My latest screw up on Uber eats.........This explains my recent delivery and a couple previous deliveries and Uber's latest response.The driver said he had to take the scotch back as well as forgetting the wine to fix the order. We had a conversation and decided he would complete the order through the app, then go back to the store and get the wine. Support called me soon after and informed me he ""dropped off the wine and left it outside"". That would have been impossible because a round trip back to the store would have taken a minimum of 45 minutes.You know this. I was friendly and understanding. He lied to you. He lied to me and ripped me off. I trusted him and he screwed me. Oh and I tipped him for the experience as well.Now you are doing the same. 2 wrongs don't make a right.You have refunded me before for frankly horrible behavior by your employees. I assumed you would do the same this time. That's why after talking to John I said I would reorder the wine and let Uber fix it later. One time a driver assaulted me by ripping my ID out of hand and was aggressive throughout the encounter. Another accused me of assault when all I did was keep an order I paid for and provided my driver's license as asked. Your app failed to ok the picture and he decided to shove me aside to retrieve the package. I was so floored all I did was stand in his way thinking ""is this really happening?"" Moments later I told him he was trespassing and to leave immediately which he DIDN'T do. I don't normally turn to violence but I would have been in my rights to physically remove him. He AND phone support tried accusing ME of assault and would be contacting the police. I called the none emergency number and found they didn't follow through on the threat.So I have had to endure 2 assaults, been ACCUSED of assault once and now one theft. Make no mistake, by knowingly charging me for a product I didn't receive IS theft.I will be talking to the store manager on Friday and see if they are willing to reimburse me the $83 for the second order. In fact John already told me I can pick up a box of wine no charge. He also said he would have driven it out to me that night but he was the only one at the store. My experience with Uber has been a complete disaster to say the least. Just because you have refunded me in the past doesn't mean you can steal from me now.I'm taking this matter to the BBB. They can't do much but it will get your behavior out of the public. I will contact the city and see what can be done about your business license. I have multiple cameras all around my house. This has all been recorded. I wasn't going to involve the police but will now about everything to date. This is a theft. Perhaps a lawsuit is in the near future? You and your employees can't do this to people without repercussions. I will do everything I can and tell anyone who listens about your bizarre company behavior. You didn't even offer a free box of wine in place of a refund.Ubers response:We can confirm that this order isn’t eligible for a refund or price adjustment.Thank you for your understanding.",2025-10-09,D D,N/A

Uber Eats,1,1 out 6 drivers recommended.,"My recent UberEATS experience was absolutely disappointing. The first driver showed up at the restaurant, picked up my order — and then disappeared. After that, I saw driver after driver (five in total!) get assigned to my order, go to the restaurant, and then drop it. I assumed maybe the food wasn’t ready.Finally, the sixth driver called me and explained that the first driver had already taken the food — and every other driver had been told the same thing at the restaurant. Yet none of them reported it or tried to follow up, until the last person. So out of six drivers, only one actually cared enough to make a call and explain what was going on.The first driver essentially stole my food, and the others just didn’t bother. It’s not just about being left hanging — it’s the complete lack of accountability and communication, not just toward customers, but between UberEATS drivers themselves.To make it worse, when I contacted customer support to cancel the order, they weren’t apologetic or even surprised. No effort to understand what happened — just generic, canned responses, like this kind of situation is completely normal. Then they told me, “Good news! We can cancel your order without a cancellation fee. Just order again!”Umm… no thanks. Uninstalling Uber.",2025-10-08,Scott,N/A
Uber Eats,1,Refused refund for undelivered order — I’ve uninstalled Uber for good,"My Uber Eats order (LKR 5,898.62) was never delivered, yet Uber refused to refund it — hiding behind a “48-hour policy”. That policy might suit Uber’s internal systems, but it doesn’t override consumer law: when goods aren’t delivered, customers are entitled to a refund.To make matters worse, every time I replied through the app, the case was automatically marked “resolved” — no human ever reviewed it. The entire experience shows how unhelpful and impersonal their customer service has become.It’s not just Uber Eats. On the rides side, my last trip to Heathrow cost £95.97, while a local cab company quoted £72 for the same journey — in a newer, cleaner vehicle.After this, I’ve uninstalled Uber for good — and I’d genuinely encourage others to do the same until Uber starts respecting its customers and basic consumer-rights standards.",2025-10-08,Prasanna,N/A

I waited an hour and some minutes for a driver to pick up my order. They sent 6 drivers out.

My last delivery driver told me to talk to customer service and report it as stolen. I spoke with two customer service representatives and they kept saying well you wasn't charged  we refunded you for your order. I told them thats not the issue. The issue is that uber eats allows thieves to work for them. I don't feel safe doing business with a company who doesn't have values, morals or principles. They allow their workers to steal. They should be held accountable and fired. If you continue to let employees get away with theft with no consequences they will continue to do so. I have been a faithful customer for years. As of today I am no longer patronizing this company. I stuck with them even when I was done wrong in the past but not this time. I'm done. I will take my business elsewhere because Uber doesn't value their customers. Door dash would never allow this the driver would have been investigated and held accountable.

They only care about taking care of their merchants and screwing you out of money. Everything they do is set up to steal from you. Check those prices they charge, it's a crazy high mark up. Not obviously this is a business and we need to make money too, but like wild mark ups that the merchants don't charge for (requiring you to add toppings to pizza that state it is included but then charge you $3 per topping lol) It's crazy to me how it is legal for them to operate the way they do. Only in America where capitalism is GOD is this allowed. The support and company are trash thieves and I will spend the rest of my life making sure everyone knows until they are no longer allowed to steal from people.",2025-10-07,Grumpy Comet,N/A
Uber Eats,1,How to make money without worrying about your customers.,"Uber Eats prides itself on slow service, delivering cold food, along with the occasional wrong order just to make things exciting. They love their delivery people placing the order right up against your front door so you have to knock it over to get to it. Another service they offer is the impossibility of contacting anyone to make an enquiry or to complain. They probably can't pay anyone enough to handle complaint after complaint.",2025-10-07,WayS,N/A
Uber Eats,1,I’ve had uber eats for a long time,"I’ve had uber eats for a long time. I even upgraded to UberOne. The amount of actual time I’ve lost is sickening. In my last 10 orders I’ve had 4 orders get cancelled either due to the driver stealing the food or the driver cancelling after I’ve already waited for the food for over an hour. Now this isn’t Ubereats fault but the way they handle it is awful. All they do is refund your order as if that’s fixed the problem from your end. They should be offering better support and refunds or offers for the time I’ve lost as a customer. And don’t get me started on the prices and all the extra charges. It’s better if you just order direct from the restaurant, use Ubereats as an Argos catalogue and go direct.",2025-10-07,Zehn,N/A

Uber Eats,1,The Diabolical Customer Support Maze,"My final Uber Eats order was an absolute disaster. The food was ready less than 30 minutes after I placed it, then sat on the counter for over an hour while drivers were assigned, cancelled, reassigned, and cancelled again. The ETA kept shifting until the food finally arrived nearly two hours later, cold, soggy, and inedible. It went straight in the bin.Customer service offered a templated apology, some vague promise to ‘review ETAs,’ and a £3 refund on a £20 order. When I asked for a proper refund (minus the rider’s tip, since it wasn’t their fault), they declared the matter closed. Basically, I am being penalised for their service failure. Reaching support felt like wandering through labyrinth land, forms, delays, dead ends. It’s remarkable how easy it is for them to take your money, and how impossibly difficult it is to reach a human when things go wrong. Also, what is the deal with these awfully written templates they're using to deal with complaints? After years as a paying subscriber and frequent customer, I’ve closed my account. Uber Eats clearly doesn’t value loyalty or basic service standards. If they can’t deliver a meal within reasonable time or provide a decent response, then what is the point continuing being a customer?",2025-10-07,BettyLou,N/A

Uber Eats,1,If I could give it 0 stars I would,"If I could give it 0 stars I would. I’ve had a couple of issues with UberEats now and will never use them again. Previously I ordered food and when it arrived there were two items missing. I let UberEats know and there response was that it had been reviewed but on this occasion they couldn’t offer a refund. I asked them to explain why, and how they made this ridiculous decision but they couldn’t. Appalling given I paid for something, didn’t receive it and then could do absolutely nothing about it. I ended up calling the restaurant and explained the situation and they kindly helped me. It happened again on Monday, after months of avoiding the app I chose to try again. The food was delivered an hour after placing the order, the delivery driver took approx. 40 mins to do a 15 min journey as they were on a bike and had multiple stops along the way. Of course my food arrived stone cold. It was inedible and a complete waste of money. It’s not rocket science that it would be cold after such a ridiculous delivery process. I complained and offered feedback to UberEats that this system doesn’t work. They ignored me, sending an automated reply 4 times. I finally had a response from a human saying again that they’d reviewed this but couldn’t give me a refund on this occasion. They just don’t care, their customer service is non existent and I would avoid like the plague.",2025-10-07,Emily,N/A

Uber Eats,1,Ubereats se moque gentiment de vous,"Bonsoir à tous les lecteurs.J’ai reçu ce matin un offre promotionnelle de Uber eats que j’use très rarement. J’ai fait une commande le soir même, mais le code promotionnel ne fonctionnait pas. Ma commande est de plus arrivée 45mn trop tôt (nous avons mangé avant 19h). Jai donc écrit sur le site ubereats pour signaler le non fonctionnement du code. La réponse est originale : je ne fais pas partie du groupe pouvant bénéficier de la promotion. Donc, si je comprends bien, ubereats vous envoie des promotion sur votre boîte email personnelle, mais ce n’est pas pour vous.Voici ma réponse :Thanks for your answer. So, if I understand correctly, you sent on my private email this very day a promotion, and when I let you know that I couldn’t use it, you answer is “you were not part of this “selected” group. It’s like someone calling you on your mobile phone, using your mobile phone number, but saying “I’m not speaking to you”. Original. I think that I won’t use anymore uber eats or uber in general at all, as you are making fun about your clients. Next uber email will be be “blocked” and send directly to junk, and I will tell this funny story to any friends or colleagues : if uber send you an offer on your email address, careful, maybe it’s not for you.

Uber Eats,1,Horrible customer service,"We are on a small vacation in Gdansk, Poland. Last night we ordered two pizzas from Felino pizza in Gdansk. We ordered at 23.35, and the receipt said we should have the food delivered between 00.20 and 00.40. 0.54 am I called the pizza place, asking how much longer. They didnt speak english, so that didnt help. At 1.30 we left the hotel to find something to eat, as we were starving. About the same time, the pizza place called, again no english. I said we no longer wanted the food, as we had been waiting two hours from ordering. They still marked the food as delivered tho, at 2.35 am - even though we never received anything. Complaining to Uber eats didnt help at all, they just claim Im not eligible for a refund. I dont care about the money, its pocket change. I do care about being ripped off tho.

Uber Eats,1,Review for Uber Eats Canada,"I’ve had two separate orders through Uber Eats that were never fulfilled, yet I was charged in full.One store (Kingsway) kept delaying delivery for nearly two hours without ever assigning a driver. Another (Team C on W Broadway) called me to say my item was out of stock and couldn’t fulfill the order. In both cases, Uber charged me, claiming the stores had already “started preparing” the orders — even though no delivery ever happened.I contacted support multiple times, but they hid behind automated responses instead of resolving the issue. Uber’s policy of charging customers for undelivered or unavailable orders is completely unacceptable and violates basic consumer protection standards.I’ve filed a complaint with Consumer Protection BC and would strongly advise others to be cautious using Uber Eats for cannabis or non-food orders.",2025-10-04,Cynthia,N/A
Uber Eats,2,Service is no longer important,"The experience on UberEats has sadly completely deteriorated in recent months.

I flagged this to support and asked for a refund but they kept sending drivers to the restaurant. I literally monitored each one going to the restaurant in the app. It wasted everyones time. This went on for close to 1.5/2 hours before they finally paid attention. More recently, they couldn’t find a courier, so by the time the food finally arrived it was stone cold. On a £40 inedible order they refunded £7. When I asked for a justification they just sent me an automated response saying it had already been refunded therefore the issue was resolved. I’ve had a great relationship with Uber/UberEats for years, but its like they really don’t care anymore. Loyalty isn’t rewarded, support are passive aggressive and service is as bad as I have received anywhere.

However, I was then unable to file an additional complaint for the damaged food, as the system indicated that I already had an active complaint and needed to wait.That complaint has since been resolved, and I received a refund for the soft drink.

Ordered food which the delivery driver failed to deliver to the correct address, sent a photo of somewhere totally different.

Uber Eats,1,Friday night Sainsbury’s order,I ordered a Sainsbury’s order this afternoon as I had friends coming over. I ordered the food and snacks and booze we would be having and was informed that it would arrive at 1810 that evening. The order then changed to arriving at 1835 and then to 1905. When I looked to find out if it was on time at 1850 it informed me it had been cancelled with no explanation!!  YOU CANNOT TRUST THIS SERVICE. HOW CAN THEY LET YOU DOWN WITH 15 MINS TO DELIVERY. MY EVENING WAS RUINED. I HAVE CANCELLED MY ACCOUNT AND WILL NEVER USE AGAIN. DISGRACEFUL!!!,2025-10-03,Gail Penrice,N/A
Uber Eats,1,S***e company,Crap business. Never got the delivery. Driver lied and said he waited for nine minutes but no one came. Driver sent a “photo” of delivery place but the photo was nothing but white space! No way to actually speak to anyone about this and after we submitted our report of the non delivery we were told the issue had been resolved and the driver acted within acceptable procedures. Bunch of BS! Will never EVER use UberEats again. £54.00 down the drain to this farce of a company!,2025-10-03,Paul Rider,N/A

Uber Eats,1,Would give them a 0 if able,"Would give them a 0 if able, their website is a buggy mess, selected my house address and it ended up trying to go to a different address the other side of the city. Tried to cancel and option only appeared after the shop had accepted meaning I couldn't get a refund. Explained this to the agent and could tell they either weren't reading the messages or was a AI/scripted response. Malicious website design along with bad customer service. Hope they go the way all other companies like them go and the market gets over saturated with options and they fade into obscurity.",2025-10-03,steven thomson,N/A

And of course when I had gotten there, the food was gone. I am still waiting to here back from Ubereats. This happened yesterday lunchtime. I am completely appalled and in shock at how someone would think it's OK to leave my food in the public street floors of London and then procees to shout at me.

After ordering a McD's  they sent me a KFC which i quite rightly refused to take from the driver.  I then contacted uber eats who refused to refund or send the correct order because i couldnt take a picture of the KFC bag with receipt - which the driver has the drivers telephone which conveniently managed to call me when he couldnt find the place, had been switched off - no doubt he had  a lovely lunch given he signed off my McDs as delivered.

Unfortunately, that didn’t happen. After texting the driver the delivery code, the delicious selection of pastries and cakes disappeared - no doubt feeding Luiz the driver’s family instead of my team.Trying to communicate with Uber about this has been near impossible, and it’s fair to say I won’t be using the service again.

Uber Eats,1,Absolutely dishonest,"Absolutely dishonest, unfair and disgusting service and policies! I’ve accidentally ordered to wrong address and when I’ve realized, I cancelled the order right away within few seconds, not even just a minute. Few seconds and 2 clicks! They didn’t say anything that if I will cancel the order I will get charged ridiculous 187$ when order was 172$… when I tried to explain their “customer service” everyone did say by the book “merchant spend time and product to prepare your order”! For 3-4 seconds!!!! They don’t listen you, don’t understand you at all!! They just hang up or end the chat without any solution or explanation. Just ends the chat after few automatic messages!!! Cancelled my long membership with them right away! I’m going to ask all my friends and relatives to do the same!

Yes, SmashBurger Bath. Now I can say for sure that there is a problem with the restaurant. As I ordered at around 17.35 and the order went to being “prepared” straight away. Then it was picked up really quickly as well. So it’s really odd that it came freezing cold. Also ,  another strange thing about the delivery. The guy who delivered to me was able to understand my very particular direction to my house perfectly  . Yet he wasn’t able to understand a 4 digit code.

Uber Eats,1,They didnt reply or help with my issue.,"I’m following up on a previous issue I raised regarding an order I placed with DIA Supermarket. In that order, four different drivers were listed as delivering my items. Two of them actually delivered part of the order, while the other two showed up, took a photo, and left without delivering anything.As a result, several items were missing from the order. I had already reported this and was told the issue would be looked into, but the ticket was closed without resolution.I want to express how uncomfortable and concerning this experience was—having multiple drivers show up at different times, including after some items were already delivered. It felt disorganized and unsettling, especially with some drivers not delivering anything but still marking the order as completed.Given the incomplete delivery and the inconvenience caused, I’m requesting a full refund for this order. Please review this matter again and let me know how it will be resolved.Thank you,",2025-10-02,PokeShop,N/A
Uber Eats,1,Worst Company Experience – Robbed by Uber,"will never use Uber again. I ordered through their app, cancelled within one minute, and yet 30 minutes later they still charged me. I called customer support, and they told me it was “policy” and that nothing could be done. I called the store directly, and they confirmed it was Uber’s fault.In the end, I was robbed of $40 with no solution, no accountability, and a customer service rep who seemed perfectly fine with that outcome. This is the worst company I’ve ever dealt with.I’ve deleted every Uber app from my phone, and I will never use them again. They clearly value money over people, and I’ll make sure to share this experience every chance I get.",2025-10-02,Matt,N/A

Uber Eats,1,I will never use Uber again!,"I will never use Uber again! It's one thing that the driver delivered my order to the wrong address and when I called him right away, he didn't want to go back and get it... but said he'd issue a credit to me. He didn't do that so I went through the customer service bot on the app the next day AND the following day. Twice reported to customer service!  The second time the bot said my issue was already resolved which it wasn't, so I restated the promise to credit my order. Nothing and zero response back to me. I get it some drivers aren't going to care about giving good service. I was able to zero out his tip. But the COMPANY has NO customer service. My order was not only not credited but the delivery fee remained! ANY company that can't take care of a customer's problem with their driver is of no use to me EVER for any of their services. Even a bot can be programmed to give a response and forward situations, that don't fit its programming, to a person with a brain. Never ever again...",2025-10-01,Connie,N/A

When I spoke with the delivery driver, he was quite rude and didn’t offer any help, more focused on rushing to his next delivery. He also pressured me into giving him the delivery code and didn’t provide any assistance.When I contacted Uber Eats, I faced extremely unhelpful and rude customer service. They initially doubted my claim, and even after I provided a screenshot of the order button showing the deal, they dismissed my complaint on a technicality. They claimed that because I didn’t take a photo of the food upon delivery, they couldn’t verify my issue.While I understand some policies, this experience really shows how little Uber Eats values customer satisfaction. I’m deeply disappointed and would not recommend using their service again.",2025-10-01,Claire Van Cappelle,N/A

And a box of aspirin all missing and they have completely refused to give me my money back. I did phone the driver as soon as I realised and he said there was nothing he could do. I'm absolutely shocked and really angry. I'm going to start using Deliveroo or Just Eat. I paid about £80 for a year's membership so again I've wasted money with that. I honestly can't believe how badly this particular service was. The person who packed it in Morrisons, Paisley obviously put someone else's name and address on the bag/s and someone else has received about £31 of MY goods! Unbelievable!
